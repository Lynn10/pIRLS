# pIRLS
This contains a fast IRLS code for solving p-norm regression problems. It is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in the
paper, "Fast, Provably convergent IRLS Algorithm for p-norm Linear Regression. Deeksha Adil, Richard Peng and Sushant Sachdeva."

# Using the Algorithm
We have included an implementation in Julia as well as Matlab. The main files have the function implementation. We have two
files, one for graph instances and one for random matrix instances, that can directly be run directly. For more details on 
these instances and the problems we are solving with them, refer to the paper. The functions can be directly used with other 
inputs as well. Refer to the test files to see how to use them.
